This repository contains Python scripts and small projects I created while following the  
**100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

Only the projects and scripts I found interesting or worth keeping are included here.

## 📦 Contents

The repository includes standalone Python scripts and mini-projects such as:

- 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors game
- 🧮 Small logic exercises
- 🛠️ Utility scripts
- 🚀 Personal variations and improvements

Each project is self-contained and can be run independently.

## ▶️ How to Run
